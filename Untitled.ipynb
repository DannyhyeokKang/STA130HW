    "Explanation: I believe the purpose of this tutorial is an introduction to using platforms like Jupyter notebooks and AI ChatBots such as Chatgpt for data analysis in Python. This exercise includes practical tasks such as finding a dataset, handling missing data, and generating summaries and code from the chatbot. I also think it helps getting used to with coding python for beginners and chatbot assistance for practical data tasks. It also envolves finding the limits of AI tools in generating results (just like HW2). Overall, it explores key statistical concepts of missing data, chatbot interactions, with the situation that  AI tools may not fully handle all problems correctly."
